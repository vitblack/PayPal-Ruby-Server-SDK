module PaypalServerSdk
  # Reauthorizes an authorized PayPal account payment, by ID. To ensure that
  # funds are still available, reauthorize a payment after its initial three-day
  # honor period expires. You can reauthorize a payment only once from days four
  # to 29.<br/><br/>If 30 days have transpired since the date of the original
  # authorization, you must create an authorized payment instead of
  # reauthorizing the original authorized payment.<br/><br/>A reauthorized
  # payment itself has a new honor period of three days.<br/><br/>You can
  # reauthorize an authorized payment once. The allowed amount depends on
  # context and geography, for example in US it is up to 115% of the original
  # authorized amount, not to exceed an increase of $75 USD.<br/><br/>Supports
  # only the `amount` request parameter.<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> This
  # request is currently not supported for Partner use cases.</blockquote>
